# Calculating $e$ to Many Digits

This program is an extension of the peer-reviewed journal article, "The Calculation of $e$ to Many Significant Digits", by A.H.J Sale. This paper provides an ALGOL 60 algorithm that accurately evaluates the digits of $e$ in sequence. This algorithm is now translated into different programming languages including Fortran, Python, C, and Ada.
